To Do:
------
1. Wufu intake form plugin for website
2. Update the other sections with the information Kasey has on the google doc

Current Issues:
---------------
+ Using the nav links scrolls to the specified section, but the navbar height isnt taken into account so it overlaps the section header.
+ Look into the book a visit button, on mobile devices it doesnt return back to its original color (burgundy)
